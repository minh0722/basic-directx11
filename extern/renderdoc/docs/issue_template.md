<!-- IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES, OR DO NOT USE THE TEMPLATE BELOW, YOUR ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED! THIS APPLIES FOR BUG REPORTS AND FEATURE REQUESTS, NO EXCEPTIONS!

The template below shows what you need to include in a good bug report, and you must use it. Feature requests don't need to include 'steps to reproduce' but the description and environment provide good context. More information is available in the documentation: https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc/blob/v1.x/docs/CONTRIBUTING/Filing-Issues.md

I'm happy to help, but you have to ensure I fully understand what you want and have the information I need. If you're unsure, please read the guide above for full information on what is expected for filing issues. -->

## Description

<!--

Here you can enter a description of either the bug that you are encountering, or the feature/improvement you'd like to see happen.

-->

## Steps to reproduce

<!--

If you're only requesting a feature you can delete this section.

For bug reports please describe the steps you can take to show the bug, in a way that I can follow them.

If you are able to share a capture, or your application, PLEASE DO THAT NOW because that is by far the easiest way to show a bug. If you cannot share because of privacy or other reasons, please say that and give as much extra information as you can.

-->

## Environment

<!-- if you are running a nightly build, list the date or commit hash for the version -->

* RenderDoc version: XXX
* Operating System: XXX
* Graphics API: XXX

<!-- More details here never hurt! For example your GPU, driver version, etc. -->
